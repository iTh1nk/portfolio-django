* This is my personal website. It includes my work related info. I will regularly do some posts here by sharing some news about coding or tech that I am interested in, also my thoughts;
* All front end structure finished by May, still need fill some contents in; Front end powered by ***ReactJS***;
* Backend handled by ***Django***, database ***PostgreSQL***; Token Authentication and group permission applied;
* ***[Semantic-UI-React](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React)*** is used for layouts;
* It's a single page app but not fully customizable only by back end;
